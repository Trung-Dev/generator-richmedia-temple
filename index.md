First lets get started with something simple.

## Initial Setup

So for this you need [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/). [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) is web scaffolding tool for modern webtools. Please go to there website if you want to know more.
Lets install yeoman globaly so its available in your terminal / command prompt as "yo"

`npm install --global yo`

_yeoman has been installed globally_

Now lets install the richmedia generator globally so yeoman can use this generator to start scaffolding you richmedia unit, used for scaffolding all your initial projects. 

`npm install -G generator-richmedia-temple`

_richmedia-temple generator for yemoan has been installed globally_

## Lets get started

Its advisable when creating a new richmedia unit to first scaffold the initial project. This will save you a lot of time and effort.

Lets run the richmedia-temple generator.

`yo richmedia-temple`

_Your now running the richmedia-temple generator. generator-richmedia-temple._

And follow the instructions, like you see below. You can use the arrow keys and enter key on your keyboard to make choices.

```bash
Welcome to Richmedia Temple Generator v1.4.1

Create, change and start developing your richmedia units

? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
❯ create a banner 
  edit a banner
```

```bash

```bash

```

```bash
? Type of banner is this (Use arrow keys)
  doubleclick 
  netflix 
❯ plain
```

## Building and Running.

You now should see a few files in the directory that you executed the generator on.

You should now go to the documentation of the [@mediamonks/richmedia-temple-server](https://mediamonks.github.io/richmedia-temple-server/) https://mediamonks.github.io/richmedia-temple-server/
